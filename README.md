# nand2tetris

This is my work for the [nand2tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome) course. If you've stumbled upon this repo as a student of the class, please consider spending more time to develop your solution before looking up mine!

Some advice:
* If you are looking for a conditional logic statement (`if`), you should see if mux/demux can work for you.
* If you are having a hard time implementing a chip, try drawing it first as a series of inputs/outputs with more simple chips.
* Start working on the ALU _early_.
